Implements the Tsetlin Machine (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01508), Coalesced Tsetlin Machine (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07594), Convolutional Tsetlin Machine (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09688), Regression Tsetlin Machine (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2019.0165), and Weighted Tsetlin Machine (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9316190), with support for continuous features, drop clause, Type III Feedback (to be published), and focused negative sampling (to be published). TMU is written in Python with wrappers for C and CUDA-based clause evaluation and updating.
